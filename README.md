### Run in Visual Studio Code

I've preset the build environment. You only need to change the `jdkPath` in `.vscode\launch.json` and `command` in `.vscode\task.json` to the `java.exe` and `javac.exe` on your machine.

#### Known Issues

1.  Scanner input not working in Visual Studio Code Debugger Console.

    Solution:
    
    If you need to input data from keyboard, you can use terminal to run the code by typing `java P3Q3`(According to the file name) after you've build and compiled the java code.
